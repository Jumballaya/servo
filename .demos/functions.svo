# Function Examples

### Functions are declared with the fn keyword
let add = fn(x, y) { x + y };

### Functions are first-class objects in servo
let anotherAdd = add;

### Functions also have closure
let closure = fn(x) {
  fn(y) {
    x + y
  }
}

let addTwo = closure(2);
log(addTwo(4))
log("")

### Recursion is allowed
let counter = fn(time) {
  log(time)
  if (time > 0) {
    counter(time - 1)
  }
}

counter(15);
